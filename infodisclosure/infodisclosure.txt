Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The secure version sanitizes user input which the insecure version doesn't. In the insecure version the code directly uses the username 
value from the request query to perform a database query without any sanitization. This leaves the application vulnerable to NoSQL injection attacks. 
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
Tampering violates the integrity aspect of CIA.
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
Besides sanitizing input, implementing comprehensive input validation mechanisms to ensure that all user-supplied data meets expected criteria can 
further reduce the risk of injection attacks.
