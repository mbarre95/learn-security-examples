• Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The insecure version is vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks. It doesn't incorporate proper authentication. It directly trusts the userId 
provided in the request body to identify the user and relies solely on checking if the user has an admin role to authorize the role update. 
The secure version checks whether the user is authenticated by verifying the presence of userId in session and then verifies if the authenticated 
user has the necessary privileges (admin) to perform the role update. 

• What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Implement input validation to ensure that the userId and newRole values provided in the request body are of the expected format and within 
acceptable ranges. This helps mitigate injection attacks and ensures that only valid data is processed.
